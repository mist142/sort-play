> [!NOTE]
> ## Sort-Play (OpenRouter fork)
>
> This is a fork of [hoeci/sort-play](https://github.com/hoeci/sort-play) that swaps the **AI Pick** feature from Google Gemini to [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai), so it works with **free** AI models.
>
> **What's different**
> - AI Pick uses OpenRouter's free models (Qwen, Llama, DeepSeek, and others). Google/Gemini models are excluded.
> - The model list is fetched live from OpenRouter, so it stays current as free models change.
> - You use your own free OpenRouter API key: **Settings → Set OpenRouter API Key**.
> - Everything else is unchanged from the original.
>
> **Getting a key**
> 1. Sign up at [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai) and go to **Keys → Create Key**.
> 2. Leave the credit limit blank or set it to 0. The free models cost nothing.
> 3. Copy the key (it starts with `sk-or-`) and paste it into Sort-Play's settings.
>
> Free models are rate-limited, so if a request fails, wait a moment or pick a different model.
>
> **Planned:** [AOTY (Album of the Year)](https://www.albumoftheyear.org) integration is coming in a future update.
>
> **Disclaimer:** The code changes in this fork and this description were written by Claude (Anthropic's AI assistant). They haven't been reviewed by the original author. Use at your own risk.
